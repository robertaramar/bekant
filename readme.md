BEKANT - An Arduino project to control your BEKANT electrically driven desk
===============

If you own an IKEA BEKANT electrical desk, you can drive the desk up and down by pressing the button on the desk's control unit. However, as I wanted to have certains heights for sitting and standing which I didn't always wanted to confirm by bending over the desk, locating a certain point in my room to confirm the height, I came up with the idea to build a little Arduino based control unit, that would allow me to automatically drive the desk up and down to the desired heights.
